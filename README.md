# shopping-cart-
# vanilla JS
#OOP
# HTML
# CSS
Basically i made this project for practicing objectg oriented programming.

# List of the functionalities i implemented
1) people can add to cart
2) people can remove single item
3)people can increase quantity of item
4)people can remove all item by clicking clear cart button
Most interesting thing is when people add to cart item you will be save in local storage .so item will not go away until they remove from cart when they refresh the website.
